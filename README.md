This is a github pages repo,  which means it is hosted for free on github.io.

Github accounts get one free site like this. 

I'm using it first for the Color Bear project. It's a creative work about the characters that inhabit raves in British Columbia, Canada. This particular simple site (HTML, CSS, Javascript on client side only) was made as an assignment for the CS50 course at Harvard.
