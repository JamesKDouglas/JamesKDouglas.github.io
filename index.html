                Color Bears are a unique and wonderful species of the rave habitat. This page is dedicated to describing their habits and friends.

                The most obvious distinguishing feature of the Color Bear is their fur which glows with a light that constantly changes color. This is mostly visible at night, with the bears appearing white during the day. Lights may adopt patterns or remain a constant color for limited periods. These bears share a passion for color, and have developed an unusual knowledge of it. They may participate in important roles during the creation of art projects using color, in particular LED light displays and laser projections. Although these bears are known for their playful behavior, their passion for color may distract them strongly towards more technical matters.

                <h2>Warning:</h2>
                <p>
                    Do not ask a color bear about color theory unless you are prepared for a long and mind-blowing conversation.

                These friendly bears eat a strictly vegan diet, without any apparent interest in consuming other animals. Adults normally are not visible during the day, preferring to go out at night dancing with their friends. Congregation may occur in forests with loud electronic music. Art projects and rivers are also known as attractants. This attraction to rivers may be a result of their friendship with the Whisky Fish.
