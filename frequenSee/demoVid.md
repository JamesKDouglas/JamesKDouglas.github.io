  - Introduction 
    - (me) Name, city, scientist who likes to make instruments and light visualizations that go with music. cs50. Art projects at bass coast and shambhala this summer.
  - Cut to screen capture.
    - show the spectrogram and describe it.
        - Each line on the screen is a piece of data captured (about 8000 samples of audio data). The dasta coming in is at 44 000 hz, so this takes a short while to collect.
        - That data is analyzed to generate a list of frequencies present. The list is made of "bins" that represent a small range of frequencies. My goal is to display on a 4K screen so I want about 4000 bins. Each frequency "bin" has an amplitude, which becomes a color on the screen. So it's just analyzing and analyzing, doing the same math over and over again on the incoming sound, then displaying what frequencies are present.
        - This is called a spectrogram.
        - Demo some sounds.
            - mimo swoop
            - Bird chirps
            - aphex twin spiral
            - tone generator
        - Note ultrasonic range.
        - Note artifacts - deadband.
  - Goal was to 
    - Make something high resolution. Looking around at existing projects, a lot of them crop and downsample more than I would like. 
        - Discuss tools used to inspect the resolution "pipe": color picker, tone genrator, loupe and aphex spiral. 
        - Explain tradeoff - more frequency bins means more samples, which means lower time domain resolution.
    - Make something easy to use. People are tired of logging in. 
        - There is some management required 
            - inputs and outputs selection. 
            - Window resizing. I played around with dynamic resizing but prefer it to be more stable.
 - Thank GPT, Richard, Mom, Dad, Duck and Spectroid. Order?

Use a clock/timer. Use the mouse a lot

Hello my name is James Douglas and this is my tour of FrequenSee

This is the final project for harvard's CS50 course. 

(close text editor)

This is a javascript program that analyzes sound data and constructs a "spectrogram". It's taking littls samples of the sound from my macbook microphone and using a fast fourier transform to generate a list of the frequencies present as well as their amplitude.

It's client side only, so you just visit the URL with your browser. 

Across the screen is the frequency axis. There is not axis label because this is meant as a display as a party and I want maximum space for all the pretty colors. 

Let's use a tone generator to explore it and point out some features. Logarithmic scale. Deadband. Frequency resolution

Time domain - aphex twin. Color meter.

Thank you
