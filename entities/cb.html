                Caution Bears are a species often found by roadsides. In British Columbia, Canada, places of frequent sitings are marked with roadside diamond black and yellow signs that simply read, "Caution Bears". As their name suggests, these bears are very cautious and rarely seen. Nevertheless, these bears are important and the signs should indicate to drivers that extra caution is indeed necessary in this area to avoid impact.

                Caution bears are rarely seen in their entire body. Instead, they are usually visible only by their head as they peer around corners. Their behavior has been described as 'tentative'. These bears may act like deer and get 'caught in the headlights'. That is, they appear to be paralyzed by headlights of cars that travel in their direction. Wildlife underpasses combined with fences on the highway are the most effective safety measure used to keep these bears safe.

                Sightings do occur in areas that are relatively safe. The dance floor as well as the Sanctuary, Cabin and Cloud areas tend to attract these bears.

                Because of their naturally caution these bears are usually as well prepared as Wooks. They often travel with water, snacks, medication, a map and global positioning system. Although cautious these bears are friendly and usually happy to share their preparations. Should you require help from a Caution Bear use the message "Oh Shit", by shouting or simple text message to any phone number.
