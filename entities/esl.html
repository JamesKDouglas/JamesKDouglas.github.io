                Normally residing near campgrounds, this lobster is known for their ability to emotionally support ravers undergoing an emotional crisis. Little else is known about them other than the striking fact that they are naturally bright red while most lobsters are grey before being cooked.

                The rave habitat has an usual abundance of crustaceans in it. The Emotional Support Lobster (ESL) is not the same as the more common Head Lobsters. ESL has a more visible tail and is rarely found on the heads of humans.
