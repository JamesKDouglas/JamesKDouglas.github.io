                Complex is the only confirmed unicorn to exist. They have a lot of complex thoughts. Favorite habitat is the top of busses in campgrounds. Frequently, this unicorn will ask people to show them their best dance move. The unicorn is said to be in a juvenile phase, although the actual age is unknown.

                Note that time may not have the same meaning for unicorns as humans or may even not be a concept that applies to them at all.

                Complex is associated with two humans who take care of them and act as a go-between between the human and non-human worlds. In particular, they explain how complicated Complex is and help them to get up on top of the bus as well as back down again.
