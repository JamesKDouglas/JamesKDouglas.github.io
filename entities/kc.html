                Kali is a manifestation of the god discussed in the Hindu religion using the same name. Kali is the creator and destroyer of worlds, including our own. They appear in our world as a green caterpillar stuffy, mostly inhabiting campgrounds rather than the dance floor.

            <div class = "section">
                The chrysalis of Kali glows green and is approximately 45cm long in the long axis. It appears as a carefully knotted ribbon. They may hang near water or ice distribution centers. How Kali can exist in a state as a caterpillar and also in multiple chrysalis at the same time is not known.
